# papaguy-tamer
intermediate-level code to parse BeRo's json output and talk with the papaguy-itself
qm210, one week before UC11

needs Python 3.9, and make sure to use the right interpreter for your system (you might need to write python3.9, pip3.9 and pay attention to your $PATH)

then use pip as usual on all the packages: (you need the vext / vext.gi for playsound)

pip install playsound pyserial flask vext vext.gi

... and whatever you need (see ImportErrors)

run with
python -m papaguy-tamer


let's see whether that works.
enjoy, QM
